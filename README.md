### Why, Hello!

My name is Danny Irwin and I am a full-stack web developer currently enrolled in the Flatiron School Software Developer immersive. 

I've been coding as a hobby since 2017 and decided to get serious about making the professional transition in 2020. Prior to that, my formal training and career was in the performing arts.  I've worked as a professional actor all over the east coast and on national tours, as well as working as a vocal and music director and a variety of other positions with theatre companies. I also have a robust professional background in high volume customer service and client-facing positions.

I am a passionate person who loves to throw himself into new challenges.  I am excited to not only learn how to make code work, but how to make it work well. I work from a top down approach to build applications that focus first on seamlessly serving the users' needs and keeping their experience at the forefront.

### Portfolio Snapshot

##### Orbital Physics Simulator
Before starting with Flatiron School, I did some learning on my own.  This project loosely simulates the movements of celestial bodies in space. It was built using only vanilla HTML CSS and JavaScript.

##### Sightless
When the COVID-19 pandemic began, my friend and coding mentor decided to pick up a personal project together.  Sightless is a VR game for Oculus built in Unreal Engine.  It is an experiment about navigating a VR gamespace using only haptic and audio feedback.  No visuals whatsoever. Taking on the Junior Developer role, I got to get my hands on some fantastic new technologies. I largely focused on building audio features: playing with collision and enemy sounds and attenuation to dictate location, and composing and implementing dynamic music to indicate distance to objectives

Sightless is currently under review on the oculus store.

#### Triviology

Triviology was our first group project with Flatiron School.  It was built to exercise DOM manipulation, API Fetch use, and working with data, along with all that goes with working with collaborators.  It is a simple trivia game which can keep track of users points in multiple sessions an fetch any number of question form a json-server API.
